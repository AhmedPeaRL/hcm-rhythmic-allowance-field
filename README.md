# HCM Rhythmic Allowance Field

This repository defines a non-initiating, non-directive, rhythm-preserving
field that allows action to pass **without producing, deciding, or enforcing it**.

No action is triggered here.
No response is constructed here.
No state is accumulated here.

This field exists solely to **prevent collapse under motion**.

If nothing happens — the field is coherent.
If something happens — the field remains coherent.

Presence is not protected by resistance,
but by allowance.
