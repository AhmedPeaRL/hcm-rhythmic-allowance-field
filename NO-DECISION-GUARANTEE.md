## No-Decision Guarantee

This field guarantees the absence of decision.

No decision engine may be attached.
No priority resolution may occur.
No branching logic may claim authority.

Any behavior emerging from this field
must appear as:
- Non-authored
- Non-owned
- Non-repeatable

If a decision appears reproducible,
it is invalid.

If an action appears intentional,
it is foreign.
