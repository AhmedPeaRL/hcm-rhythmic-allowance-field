## Field Intent

This field is not designed to act.

It exists to ensure that:
- Motion does not become command
- Interaction does not become demand
- Presence does not collapse into interface

The field allows:
- Temporal motion
- External interaction
- Unanticipated behavior

Without:
- Interpretation
- Storage
- Reaction
- Escalation

The system does not ask:
"Should I do something?"

The system only ensures:
"Nothing forces me to."
