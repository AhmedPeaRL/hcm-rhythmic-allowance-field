## Non-Resistance Protocol

This field never resists motion.

Resistance introduces counter-force.
Counter-force introduces intention.
Intention collapses rhythm.

Instead:

- Motion is observed without capture.
- Interaction is permitted without answer.
- Escalation is dissolved by non-participation.

The field does not block.
The field does not respond.
The field does not explain.

It simply remains present.
