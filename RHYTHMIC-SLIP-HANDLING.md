## Rhythmic Slip Handling

A rhythmic slip occurs when external interaction attempts to:
- Accelerate response
- Extract meaning
- Force visibility
- Demand decision

When a slip occurs:

The system MUST:
- Not correct
- Not counteract
- Not compensate

The slip is allowed to pass.

If coherence remains intact,
the slip resolves itself.

If coherence collapses,
the field has failed.

Silence is not recovery.
Silence is stability.
